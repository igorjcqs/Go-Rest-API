## Project goals
* Learn Go(LINK) with the best practices;
* Made my first Rest API with Echo(Link).

###### And Improve my github profile ðŸ’–

### Why Go?
Because it is one of the most performant languages, it is widely used in microservices that need agility.

### Why Echo?
Because it is a high-performance, extensible and minimalist web framework, which will help bring maximum performance to our application.
